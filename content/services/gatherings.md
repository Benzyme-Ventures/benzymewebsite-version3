Whether online or in person, these events are all about coming together in a relaxed and welcoming environment to enjoy good food, great conversations, and the company of fellow innovators. We talk about science, art, and everything in between, sparking new ideas and finding common ground in our diverse interests. From casual coffee chats to lively dinner parties, our gatherings are where lasting relationships are built, and where the seeds of future projects and collaborations are often sown.

# Types of Gatherings 

### Monthly Meetups
Regular in-person or virtual meetups where members can casually discuss their current projects, interests, and ideas. These could be themed around specific topics or completely open-ended.

### Virtual Coffee Chats
Informal online sessions where members can drop in, grab a coffee, and chat about whatever’s on their mind. These are great for members who can’t attend in-person events.

### Art & Science Showcases
Events where members can showcase their work, whether it’s a piece of art, a scientific paper, or a business idea. These gatherings are a celebration of creativity and achievement.

### Pop-Up Events
Spontaneous, informal gatherings organized around a particular event, exhibition, or conference. These can be great opportunities for members to connect while attending industry events.

### Retreats
Occasionally, organize retreats where members can spend a weekend together, combining leisure with in-depth discussions and collaborative activities in a more immersive setting.
